## **2. Brand Narrative**

### **The Situation**

Ukraine faces ongoing hardship: displacement, injury, isolation, and resource shortages. Vulnerable people often receive help last—or not at all.

### **Who We Are**

A **small, volunteer-run Ukrainian NGO** operating for 8+ years.

We live where we serve and respond quickly to emerging needs.

We fill critical humanitarian gaps: food, medical supplies, accommodation, and mobility support.

### **Why We Exist**

Because dignity matters.

Because small actions change lives.

Because donors who care make real impact possible.

### **What Makes Us Different**

- 100% volunteer-run
- Local presence and cultural understanding
- Fast, flexible crisis response
- Long-standing community trust
- Transparent use of every donation

### **Our Belief**

People are strongest when they stand together.

Every act of generosity becomes part of someone's survival, recovery, and hope.

## **5. Copywriting Principles**

### **Our Copywriting Philosophy**

Copywriting at Undaunted Spirits is **not persuasion for its own sake**.

It is the discipline of **simple, honest communication** — helping people understand:

- what is happening,
- who needs help,
- and how their action creates real impact.

Our writing must feel **human, grounded, and credible** — never abstract or promotional.

### **The Three-Yes Test (Mandatory)**

Every headline, donation prompt, or key sentence should pass **all three**:

**1. Can you visualize it?**

If the reader closes their eyes, they should see something specific.

**2. Can it be proven true or false?**

Avoid vague claims. Use facts, actions, quantities, or observable outcomes.

**3. Could only Undaunted Spirits say this?**

If another charity could reuse the sentence unchanged, rewrite it.

If a line fails any of these → it gets revised or removed.

### **From Abstract to Concrete**

We actively **replace abstract language with lived reality**.

**Avoid**

- "Making a difference"
- "Changing lives"
- "Supporting communities"

**Prefer**

- "Delivered 52 food parcels to displaced families"
- "$30 covered three days of meals for one elderly person"
- "Volunteers carried generators to homes without electricity"

**Rule:**

If you can't point to it, count it, photograph it, or witness it — it doesn't belong in our copy.

### **Facts Before Feelings**

Emotion comes **after** credibility.

We start with:

- Numbers
- Locations
- Actions
- Timeframes

Then allow meaning to emerge naturally.

**Example**

> "Today our volunteers delivered 52 food packages to families displaced from Kharkiv."
> 

Not:

> "Today we made a powerful impact in the lives of vulnerable families."
> 

### **Speed of Understanding (The 2-Second Rule)**

Every public-facing message should pass the **"One Mississippi, Two Mississippi" test**.

If someone can't understand the message within two seconds:

- simplify,
- shorten,
- or make it more concrete.

This is especially critical for:

- homepage heroes
- social posts
- donation CTAs
- banners and ads

Clarity beats cleverness. Always.

### **Show, Don't Claim**

We do not describe ourselves with adjectives unless we **prove them immediately**.

**Instead of**

> "We are transparent and efficient."
> 

**Show**

> "100% volunteer-run. Every donation goes directly to aid."
> 

**Instead of**

> "We act quickly."
> 

**Show**

> "Volunteers delivered aid within 24 hours of the request."
> 

### **Conflict Without Drama**

Good writing often contains contrast — but never sensationalism.

We use **quiet contrast**:

- before vs after
- absence vs presence
- without help vs with help

**Example**

> "Before the delivery, this family had no heating. Tonight, they do."
> 

No shock. No guilt. Just reality.

### **Write for the Reader's Context**

Always ask:

- Where is this being read?
- How distracted is the reader?
- What do they already know?

**Street-level rule:**

Write as if the reader is:

- on their phone,
- mid-scroll,
- emotionally open but time-poor.

Short paragraphs. One idea at a time. White space is intentional.

### **Writing Is Rewriting**

Simple writing is the result of **multiple revisions**.

Our internal standard:

- Cut unnecessary words
- Remove extra ideas
- Prefer one strong sentence over three weak ones

**Internal test:**

If a sentence can be removed without weakening meaning — remove it.

### **Words and Design Work Together**

Copy does not live alone.

Text must work **with**:

- layout
- hierarchy
- imagery
- spacing

We write copy **in the environment where it appears** (Notion, website, email, social), not in isolation.

### **Copy North Star**

When unsure how to write something, default to this:

> "What happened. Where. For whom. Because of you."
> 

That is enough.
