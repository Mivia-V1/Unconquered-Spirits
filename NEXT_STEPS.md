## 🚀 Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Connect to GitHub (HIGH PRIORITY)

You mentioned you have a draft on GitHub. Here's how to connect this project to your GitHub repository:

#### Option A: If you have an existing GitHub repository

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Option B: Create a new GitHub repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository (e.g., "undaunted-spirits-website")
3. **Don't initialize** with README (we already have one)
4. Copy the repository URL
5. Run these commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/undaunted-spirits-website.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. View Your Website Locally

Open the website in your browser:

```bash
# Option 1: Direct file opening
# Simply double-click index.html

# Option 2: Use Python (if installed)
cd /Users/gavinwerner/NGO
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000

# Option 3: Use Node.js http-server
npx http-server
# Then visit: http://localhost:8080
```

### 3. Test the Bilingual Functionality

- Click the "EN | UA" button in the navigation
- Verify all content switches properly
- Check that language preference persists on page reload
